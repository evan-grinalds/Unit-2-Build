A basic template for starting data science projects.

# DS Project Template

Project structure is an important thing in programming as well as data
science. We want to facilitate peer review, and a prerequisite to that
is contributing, clean, organized, code that allows for anyone who visits
your project to be able to reproduce those same results without having
to contact you personally.

This is the purpose of a README, be sure to complete this as part of
your project.
