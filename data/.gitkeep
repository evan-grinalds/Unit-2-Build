This is the folder where you should keep your data typically you will
have at least 2 separate sub-folders inside here.

/raw
    The original data as it was when it came from its source

/processed
    This folder is for your wrangled data set.

.gitkeep files are just a convention to allow for the pushing of
empty directories to the VCS repository. Feel free to delete this
file once you moved your data in here.
